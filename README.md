# STM32_baremetal_programming

This repository is used for studying purpose. I have done a little of bare-metal programming for STM32 in a previous repository. However, I find it not good enough for quickly adaption in case I switch to other MCUs. I find my way of programming is unprofessional as well. Therefore this repo is created aiming to restructure the whole project, with better layers design, modules design and the programming design.
